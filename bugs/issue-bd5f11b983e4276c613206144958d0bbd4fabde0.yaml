    switched to icedax
    this does not fix my problem - it is kernel related: SCSI cdrom audio grabs only work as root, regardless of using icedax or cdparanoia

    the problem with the user-acces resulted from /dev/cdrom pointing to /dev/scd0 instead of /dev/sg0
    with the latter both cdparanoia and icedax work
    setting CDDA_DEVICE to 0,5,0 makes it work for me without touching the /dev/cdrom symlink
