grabcd is an audio CD ripping and encoding suite

== What does it do?

"scancd.pl" reads a CD and lets you enter track information (I'm no
fan of CDDB as the data there is very limited - think of a hit sampler
CD with different artists, you can't have a different artist per
track).

"grabcd.pl" will then read the CD and start the encoding via
"encode.pl" (this will be done automatically).  You will get OGG
encoded files in a specified directory hierarchy.


== What's special about this?

grabcd.sh and encode.sh can run on different machines.  This is
essential for me as my CD-ROM is in my slow workstation while the
server with the fast CPU has no CD-ROM.


== How to use it?

Generate a config file, either /etc/grabcd.conf for everyone or
~/.grabcd for yourself.

This is an example for "everything local":

CDINFO_TEMP=/tmp/cdinfo
CDINFO_REMOTE=/mnt/storage/scancd
ENCODE_HOST=localhost
ENCODE_BINARY=/usr/bin/encode.pl
ENCODE_NICE=20
ENCODE_PATH=/mnt/storage/ogg


This is an example for "networked operation":

CDINFO_TEMP=/tmp/cdinfo
CDINFO_REMOTE=mitch@yggdrasil.mitch.h.shuttle.de:/home/mitch/ogg/scancd
ENCODE_HOST=mitch@yggdrasil.mitch.h.shuttle.de
ENCODE_BINARY=/home/mitch/bin/encode.pl
ENCODE_NICE=20
ENCODE_PATH=/home/mitch/ogg



== Configuration options

CDINFO_TEMP    - The artist/track data is temporarily stored here
CDINFO_REMOTE  - The artist/track data is archived here.  Useful if
                 you want to reread a CD later.  Just copy the
                 appropriate file to $CDINFO_TEMP and start grabcd.pl.
ENCODE_HOST    - Where to run encode.pl.  Set to empty or "localhost"
                 for local operation.  Set to a "hostname" or
                 "user@hostname" for remote operation.
ENCODE_BINARY  - Where to find the encode.pl binary.
ENCODE_NICE    - Nicelevel for encode.pl.
ENCODE_PATH    - Where to put the encoded files.
